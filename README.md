## What is Next.js?
`Next.js` is a React framework that pulls together many of the features that normally need to be "bolted" onto a standard React application:
* Routing
* API Routes
* CSS Modules
* Code splitting and bundling
* Image optimization
* Internationalization
* Automatic polyfills
* [TypeScript support out of the box](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript)

## Who created Next.js?
`Next.js` was created by Vercel.
